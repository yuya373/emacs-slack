;;; Commentary:

;; Optional companion to slack-org-link.el that turns Slack message
;; alerts into Org TODO headings, so that messages can be managed from
;; the Org agenda:
;;
;;   (use-package emacs-slack
;;     :config
;;     (require 'slack-org-alert)
;;     (setq slack-org-alert-file "~/agenda/Slack.org")
;;     (slack-org-alert-setup))
;;
;;   (add-to-org-agenda-files "~/agenda/Slack.org")
;;
;; The alert info plists emacs-slack passes to alert contain :title,
;; :message and :data (:team-id :room-id :room-name :team-name :ts).
;; Alerts only arrive for connected teams, so captured headings always
;; store a permalink link; alerts without message identity (no :data)
;; are skipped.  Duplicate alerts (same link already present in the
;; file) are skipped too.
